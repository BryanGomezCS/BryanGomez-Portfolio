# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

A classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game built with Python. This project serves as a simple introduction to programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, and user input. The game is played against the computer, which makes its move randomly.

#### Features
- User vs Computer gameplay
- Randomized computer choices
- Input validation to handle invalid entries
- Simple and clear console interface

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
